# What the Query? A brief look at [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/adapters/react-query)

Welcome back to episode 2 of Rocking the Boat, where I ask the question "can we?" so that it's easier to spend more time later asking, "should we?". This week, React Query by Tanner Linsley is up! ðŸ¥³

## Why now?

I've been giving my best shot at an Accessibility Audit (they're super worthwhile and I'm learning loads!). I decided to pick [sweet-as-organics-api](https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/challenges/tree/main/packages/sweet-as-organics-api) because I've helped students out with it but haven't tried it myself. It's an awesome challenge and really well presented!

I was neck deep in reducers and actions when I realised, Redux is hard.

So, I wanted to look at the same thing built with React Query, a server-state management solution.

# What is State Management?

I think there are two types of State Management that we run into or have a need for:

- **Application State** (_stuff that lives on the client that we want to render on the client_):
  - Which page am I on?
  - What colour scheme am I using? (light/dark/custom)
  - What are the items in my local shopping cart?

- **Server State** (_stuff that lives on the server that we want to render on the client_):
  - What are the top 50 tweets in my feed right now?
  - Who are my friends? Which ones are online?
  - Who are the Wombles? What rubbish are they picking up? What traits do they have?
  - ... Anything that persists in a database or _somewhere else_

Redux has historically been used to solve both of these problems, it introduced the Flux pattern (action -> dispatcher -> store -> view) with stores and reducers and whatnot. 

Stores and reducers are an easy way to compartmentalize the logic for _how_ state changes. It's great, I can isolate my logic and test it as it grows in complexity. I think Redux introduced a really important pattern that have sparked other great libraries (and even encouraged React to include useReducer as a state management hook natively)
